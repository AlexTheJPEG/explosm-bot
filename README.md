# explosm-bot
A Mastodon bot (https://botsin.space/@explosmbot) that prints randomly-generated comics (http://explosm.net/rcg)

## üêò Why Mastodon?
This was originally a Twitter bot, but because Twitter doesn't care about its users, they're starting to add a paywall for their API starting February 9th. Because I don't want to pay to run a little side project, I moved to a Mastodon instance [specifically made to host bots](https://botsin.space). Feel free to follow the bot and add it to your timeline!
